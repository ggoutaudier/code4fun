# Welcome!
Welcome to the Code4Fun Hyperledger Meetup in Geneva.
This page contains the script that we will follow during the workshop.

# Prerequisites
In this workshop we will play with the latest version of Hyperledger Fabric, currently version 1.3.

Please verify that you have all the prerequisites listed on this page:
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html

You can safely skip the node.js configuration as we will provide a docker image containing the client application.


# Hyperleder network setup
First, choose your working directory and clone the code4fun Git repository:
`git clone https://github.com/ggoutaudier/code4fun`

We also need to download the Hyperledger 1.3 docker images and binaries. Hyperledger provides a simple script to do that:
`curl -sSL http://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s 1.3.0 1.3.0 0.4.13`

## Test




# Chaincode installation

# Optional - To go further
